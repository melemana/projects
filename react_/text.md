the Css Notes
>> when we give the flex property for an element as 1 which is flex:1 it means we are making the element to expaand and fill all the available space along the main axis of the flex container. making a div element diaplay flex and its childrens having both a flex 0f 1 make them to share the the available space equally. making one a flex of 2 make it to take more space.

>>the outline property in the project we used it to add a visible border around an element. just outside of the element's actal border or content.
